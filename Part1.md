## Which package/library did you select?
- For this exploration activity I selected the Faker library which is used to generate massive amounts of fake/random data for testing and development purposes. This library is used by importing the faker library which allows access to all different types of built in methods. Using different methods of of this library and the basic functions of javascript, you can generate useful data like what is shown in the sample program.

## What is the package/library?
- The purpose if the Asciimatics library is be incorperated into interactive applications using its text-based animations. There are a lot of possibilities when it comes to this package such as, generating random numbers withing ranges, financial data such as credit card information, address information such as the country, street and house number where someone may reside, generating fake image URL's for testing, ect.

- After installing the Faker library, we can start programming. Below are some examples of ways we can use Faker:

## What are the functionalities of this package?
- Some basic functionalities of this package would definately lie in the catagories of text and basic data types. These include generating fake names for people or companies, fake email addresses, fake street addresses, etc. In the catagory of text, it is most often that we generate random paragraphs, word and sentences.

## When was it created?
- Faker.js was created by Marak Squires and was released on April 22, 2010.

## Why did you select this package/library?
- I chose to work with Faker because I though it would be a good opportunity to get learn something that i'd never really heard of or considered learning before. It was also a great way to improve my programming skills, which is something that I haven't had the chance to practice outside the lab with JavaScript. 
  
## How did learning this package/library influence your learning of the language?
- I feel as though learning this library really helped me with getting extra practice with the basics of JavaScript. I really enjoyed learning a new way to manipulate the language and generate random data in a different way.

## How was your overall experience with this package/library?
- Overall I had a good experience with the library. I felt it was relitivly easy to pick up on and there were lot of resources out there to provide structured guidance. I would recommend this library to anyone who is looking to expand their knowledge of JavaScript at a beginners level. I would continue using this library just for in the future for testing purposes as it would be extremely helpful to generate massive amounts of testable data.
